	<p class="">For over a hundred years, Exeter students created the newspaper <i>The Exonian</i> to bring a level of communication and information that was not before seen on preparatory school campuses. The newspaper and its dedicated team worked tirelessly to produce issue after issue. Although the individuals in the team behind this massive student organization have changed, the organization's goal has not. Today, 135 years after its creation, the team behind <i>The Exonian</i>&nbsp;still remains faithful to its mission of enervating the campus at large and delivering up-to-date and accurate news, events, and reporting.</p><p class="">We live in a different world now though, one that is very different from the one that members of the Class of 1878 experienced. No longer are we tied to information by paper or magazine: with the touch of our smartphones and the swipe of a mouse, we receive information over the air and photos, videos, and media through the Internet. For the first time ever, major historical events are being broken on Twitter faster than they appear on television or even on major news media websites. As a generation of millennials, our world has indeed transformed the way we consume content.</p><p class="">We at <i>The Exonian</i>, of course, are very cognizant of this change. Rather than repudiating it, we have embraced it: last year, members of <i>The Exonian</i>'s online board unveiled the new <i>Exonian Online</i>, a breakthrough website that featured more multimedia content. We welcomed the new visuals and photograph galleries that the previous website could not have supported. The 4th Exonian Web Board, building on the work of those before, has tirelessly pushed this organization into the new age while making certain that older and more timeless ideals are held onto.&nbsp;</p><p class="">The virtues of excellent reporting, breathtaking photography, and intriguing columnists remain our core ethos<span style="font-size: 1em;">. The newspaper is not going away for a while, and it's going to remain at the core of what we do. But we have a new opportunity at hand, one that should be welcomed with open arms -- we need to push for more interactive media, more visually stunning elements, and more pieces that cause us to think.</span></p><p class="">That's what <i>The Exonian</i>&nbsp;Experiences are about. We want to take photography and art to the next level, create a journalism and information revolution that is a pleasure to experience. And we want to take your breath away while we do it.</p><p class="">Join us on this adventure. We promise not to disappoint.</p><p class="">Brandon Wang<br><i>Technical Director, The Exonian Online</i></p><figure class="k-content-embed">
