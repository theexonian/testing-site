We make guesses as to the state of our campus, throw out statistics often no better than rough predictions, and pretend that those of us in trouble are not and that those of us breaking rules are low or high in number. No longer.</p> <div class=mainbody-text> <p>Frustrated with a lack of information and transparency regarding key issues on campus, <em>The Exonian</em> Online disseminated a survey to all 1080 Exeter students. The survey, approximately five minutes in length, asked a variety of questions, about everything from demographics and academics to drugs, mental health and sex. We were pleasantly surprised with the results: within only five days, we received 610 responses. That's 56% of the student body.</p> <div class=graph_padded id=graph_demo1 style="height:350px;margin:30px 0"></div> <script type=text/javascript>$(function(){$("#graph_demo1").highcharts({chart:{type:"column"},title:{text:"Survey participants by gender and grade"},xAxis:{categories:["Preps","Lowers","Uppers","Seniors"]},yAxis:{title:{text:"Number of participants"}},series:[{name:"Male",data:[65,63,75,66],color:"#455cdb"},{name:"Female",data:[64,70,89,85],color:"#d65adb"},{name:"Gender not listed",data:[6,2,5,2],color:"#AAA"}]})});</script> <p>The results encompass a diversity of opinion in regards to gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic identity and sexual orientation. In many ways, this survey represents all that Exonians are: varied in backgrounds but ultimately candid in opinion. We asked some hard questions, and our students answered.<br />&nbsp;</p> <p>The development of the survey questions took around two weeks. A careful draft was created, and the review process began. We formed several focus groups containing students with diverse backgrounds and examined each and every question. The Gay-Straight Alliance critiqued questions regarding sexuality, and Active Minds took care to revisit each question about mental health. Finally, a group of faculty members reviewed the questions. </p> <p>With the questions ready, the design of the survey itself began. Unlike other surveys presented to the student body, our design presented only one question at a time, provided the option to skip questions and added and replaced questions based on previous responses. Our survey was answerable on phones and tablets, with keyboards and with fingers. Most importantly, it was built from the ground up to be completely anonymous.</p> <p>When results were received, they were continuously tallied into a running total based on each demographic. We focused our breakdown based on grade, gender and occasionally race and socioeconomic identity. Finally, with all results in, we spent several late nights compiling and analyzing the data.<br />&nbsp;</p> <p>What you see below are the fruits of our labor. We are not alone: <em>The Phillipian</em>, Phillips Academy Andover's student newspaper, conducts a "State of the Academy" survey <a href=http://www.phillipian.net/sota13/sections/academics.html>similar to ours</a>. Harvard, Princeton and Yale are among institutions that also survey yearly. But <em>The Exonian</em> Online's "This Is Our School" survey is uniquely Exonian.</p> <p>The discussion does not end here. We encourage you to provide your own thoughts and feedback. In addition, we assembled a panel of <em>Exonian</em> board members who have offered their commentary on many of the survey results. Although my own commentary is a combination of information and opinion, the commentary expressed by those panelists are their own opinion and do not reflect the opinions of <em>The Exonian</em> as a whole.

I couldn't tell from the perfect assimilation of different races on the homepage Exeter's website, featuring students in "What's My Day Like?" (which happens to lack an Asian kid).</p><p> Diversity is a great thing to have; being surrounded by a wide variety of interests and backgrounds is what makes this place special and different from what you'd find at home. But there's definitely a stigma surrounding the subject, one that Exeter propagates. Too many times have I heard somebody say, "that photo is so perfectly diverse!" in reference to a photo in our course book or in some picture that the school has posted on its Facebook page.</p> </div> <div style=clear:both></div> </div> </div> <div class=graph-block> <div class="container graph-block-right"> <div class=graph-block-graph> <div class=graph_padded id=graph_roleofrace style=height:550px></div> <script type=text/javascript>$(function(){$("#graph_roleofrace").highcharts({chart:{type:"bar",},plotOptions:{bar:{stacking:"percent"}},title:{text:"Does your racial/ethnic identity play a noticeable role at Exeter?"},xAxis:{categories:["All responses","White/Caucasian","Asian","Other/mixed","Black/African-American","Hispanic"]},yAxis:{title:{text:"Percentage of responses per category"}},series:[{name:"Yes, in a negative way",data:[124,26,29,8,14,5],color:"#ce4949"},{name:"No",data:[314,165,27,16,5,6],color:"#adadad"},{name:"Yes, in a positive way",data:[157,41,34,10,13,13],color:"#5ccc3a"}]})});</script> </div> <div class="graph-block-commentary graph-block-commentary-overflow" style=height:550px> <h3>Commentary</h3> <p><span>Brandon:</span> Race plays a role in the lives of about half of us and little to no role in those of the other half. There are a few things to note here: first, whites/Caucasians generally felt their race/ethnicity impacted them the least (for both negative and positive). Hispanics felt that it affected them positively the most.</p><p> On the other hand, nearly half of blacks/African-Americans felt that their race impacted them negatively. Nearly a third of Asians felt similarly. Clearly, there is some work to do here.</p><p> Due to small sample size, Middle Easterners, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders were only included in "all responses." The graph has been sorted by number of respondents in each category.</p> <p><span>Amanda:</span> Race distinction is undeniably present in many ways at Exeter, as it is in life outside of the "bubble." One way I've seen this demonstrated is in club demographics. Take The Exonian, for example. On the Editorial Board, the number of Asians outweigh all other races. Various dance groups, such as Outkast, Precision, and Imani, are comprised of primarily black/African-American students. And American Culture Club? I think you get it. Whether this is affects Exeter as a whole positively or negatively is hard to determine, however. As shown in the graphs, the red and the green are almost equivalent.</p> </div> <div style=clear:both></div> </div> </div> <div class=graph-block> <div class="container graph-block-left"> <div class=graph-block-graph> <div class=graph_padded id=graph_political style=height:420px></div> <script type=text/javascript>$(function(){$("#graph_political").highcharts({chart:{type:"pie"},title:{text:"Political affiliation of respondents"},series:[{type:"pie",name:"Number of respondents",data:[{name:"Democratic",y:217,color:"#25cad1"},{name:"I don't care/undecided/other",y:199,color:"#c3c3c3"},{name:"Independent",y:95,color:"#919191"},{name:"Republican",y:87,color:"#d33b3b"}]}]})});</script> </div> <div class="graph-block-commentary graph-block-commentary-overflow" style=height:420px> <h3>Commentary</h3> <p><span>Brandon:</span> Half of us identify as Democratic and Republican, and the other half are more nuanced or just don't care. Of the polarized bunch, there are about twice as many Democrats as there are Republicans.</p><p> This is an interesting discovery. In our focus groups many of us assumed Republicans would stand as a much smaller minority in what is commonly perceived as a "liberal" campus. Democrats dominate, but not overwhelmingly so.</p> <p><span>Katie:</span> The Democrat to Republican ratio isn't too surprising given the concentration of Exonians from the northeast US, but the number of students who identify as "I don't care/undecided/other" is rather large. Students at Exeter are encouraged on a daily basis to form and voice their opinions, yet many are indifferent or undecided in terms of their core political views. It could be that those students are just unwilling to identify with one of the political parties listed, but if they all simply don't care about their political position, it may be slightly troubling when Exonians hit the voting booths next election.</p> </div> <div style=clear:both></div> </div> </div> <div class=graph-block> <div class="container graph-block-right"> <div class=graph-block-graph> <div class=graph_padded id=graph_socioeconomic style=height:400px></div> <script type=text/javascript>$(function(){$("#graph_socioeconomic").highcharts({chart:{type:"pie"},title:{text:"Socioeconomic identity of respondents"},series:[{type:"pie",name:"Number of respondents",data:[["Upper class",110],["Upper middle class",210],["Middle class",171],["Lower middle class",66],["Lower class",38]]}]})});</script> </div> <div class="graph-block-commentary graph-block-commentary-overflow" style=height:400px> <h3>Commentary</h3> <p><span>Brandon:</span> This question is neat because it invites respondents to consider their socioeconomic identity in a qualitative way; we asked, in other words, about how they perceived themselves.</p><p> The results are in, then: Exonians are overwhelmingly middle to upper class.</p> <p><span>Zoha:</span> This graph supports the statistic that approximately 45% of Exonians receive some form of financial aid.

Indeed, moving in either the lower or upper class directions gives us stronger roles, for both positive and negative.</p> <p><span>Jay:</span> What is interesting to note here is that more students who classify as lower and lower middle class believe that they are affected negatively than those in any other socioeconomic class, even though a vast majority of them claim that their financial aid package is enough.</p><p> This highlights the importance of money (outside of tuition) on our daily lives at Exeter. For example, students who classify as lower or lower middle class can feel negatively affected because they have a limited amount of Lion Card money, cannot order in a lot or pay for dorm grill, etc. </p> </div> <div style=clear:both></div> </div> </div> <div class=graph-block> <div class="container graph-block-right"> <div class=graph-block-graph> <div class=graph_padded id=graph_financialaidenough style=height:350px></div> <script type=text/javascript>$(function(){$("#graph_financialaidenough").highcharts({chart:{type:"bar",},plotOptions:{bar:{stacking:"percent"}},title:{text:"If you are on financial aid, do you feel Exeter provides enough?"},xAxis:{categories:["All responses","Lower class","Lower middle"]},yAxis:{title:{text:"Percentage of responses per category"}},series:[{name:"No",data:[11,5,6],color:"#d35454"},{name:"Yes",data:[58,22,36],color:"#76bc5d"}]})});</script> </div> <div class=graph-block-commentary style=height:350px> <h3>Commentary</h3> <p><span>Brandon:</span> To keep the survey as short as possible, this question was only displayed to those who answered lower or lower-middle class.

But when I broke the data down by gender, I found a remarkable disparity. See for yourself: while males tended to find no disadvantage, 73% of females found a disadvantage. Compare that to only 12% of males. Something's not right, and we males need to take a close look at why.</p> <p><span>Katie:</span> This statistic seems to reinforce itself. If so many more women see the presence of gender discrimination, or other disadvantages, than men, it can't be helping the issue.</p> <p><span>Amanda:</span> I actually disagree with Brandon on this one, in that at first glance, the number of those who find themselves disadvantaged in respect to the entire student body is very substantial. Regardless of age, a little over 25% of students feel this way. And it's a big problem. How are women to thrive in such an interactive environment while facing such a disadvantaged? Do you think that maybe this only exacerbates the "culture of competition" that 96% of us felt?

Yet according to Andover's "State of the Academy 2013," 28.13% of students had previously had sex, while our graphs show a figure topping 34%.</p> <p>It also appears that Exonians who enter the Academy as upperclassmen were more likely to have pre-Exeter sex that younger new Exonians, which might help shed some more light on how Exeter fares in comparison to national and public school averages.</p> </div> <div style=clear:both></div> </div> </div> <div class=graph-block> <div class="container graph-block-right"> <div class=graph-block-graph> <div class=graph_padded id=graph_sexbreakdown style=height:550px></div> <script type=text/javascript>$(function(){$("#graph_sexbreakdown").highcharts({chart:{type:"bar",},plotOptions:{bar:{stacking:"percent"}},title:{text:"Have you ever had sex?
