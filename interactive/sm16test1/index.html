      <p id="blurb"><strong>The 138th Board of <i>The Exonian</i></strong> facilitated this survey in the wake of reports on sexual misconduct cases that occurred on and around campus during the 1970s, 80s and in recent years. The emergence of news surrounding these cases have altered our community and culture substantially. Understanding the emotions of our student body today regarding these charged issues is vital as Exeter works to understand the school better and move forward.

          <strong>Henrietta:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an interesting statistic for us to grapple with. This discrepancy shows us that while it isn&apos;t uncommon for any student to believe that there is a problem surrounding sexual misconduct at our school, girls feel it more strongly, pushing their numbers into the majority.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Philip:</strong> Considering 60 percent of male respondents felt the way the Academy responds to sexual misconduct cases seems biased towards females, I don&rsquo;t find it surprising that not a single male victim reported his case to the administration. That being said, the percentage is not much higher for females&mdash;it&rsquo;s clear we need to do a better job creating an environment where students of both genders feel comfortable reporting their cases. It would be interesting to do a follow up to this question after a year to see if our current discussions help foster a long term cultural shift in helping victims feel safe, supported and protected. Yet it&rsquo;s clear not much has changed in the past two months, which is understandable considering the short time frame.

          <strong>Joonho:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m glad that over 50 percent of the student body believes that there is a sufficient amount of programming on sexual misconduct. However, it is important to note that this statistic does not request student opinions on the efficacy of the programming.

          <strong>Henrietta:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;50% of male respondents were confident or very confident that if they or their friends reported a case, it would be handled well. But as in the gender disparity in the first question, it&apos;s important to notice that only 31.69% of girls hold the same belief. A student body ought to have a more substantial majority that feels enthusiastically protected by our administration under all circumstances, and that is clearly not the case right now.

          <strong>Joonho:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;It&apos;s interesting to note that younger students were more prone to gain trust in the administration following the article&apos;s publication than older students. Whether due to past experiences or simply a rather jaded attitude, it seems that upperclassmen are now less likely to seek the administration when dealing with sexual misconduct cases.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Henrietta:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This graph adds basis to the suspicion that the longer we are students at Exeter, the more cynical we become. While preps and underclassmen in general appear to be a little more uncertain in their thoughts, upperclassmen and seniors in particular feel most decisively negative about the administration and its actions, which is not a particularly heartening fact.

          <h3>Commentary</h3>
          <strong>Melissa:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidently, there&apos;s a deep disparity in opinion among genders. The majority, 60.73%, of male respondents believe that the Academy&apos;s response is biased in favor of females while 44.44% of females believe that the way in which the Academy responds to sexual misconduct is unbiased in regards to gender. It&apos;s also interesting to note, very few males (8.36%) believe that the system is biased in favor to their gender while approximately a quarter (26.85%) of females feel that the system is biased in favor to their gender. 
<br />
<br />
It makes me wonder: is there bias in the current system? Or is this response a continuation of the longstanding, historically rooted societal norm to discredit female victims? A reverse victimization of men? A growing fear among males to be falsely accused? The issue at hand is complex and multidimensional. Are there now societal pressures for schools to support female victims? What I see here is ultimately a key area for discussion and improvement. Often in these discussions, genders have been alienated from each other. We need to bring together male and female student voices and perspectives to bridge this gap and to begin work towards changing this potentially dangerous dynamic.

          <strong>Henrietta:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Boys are twice as likely to not know a victim of sexual misconduct as they are to know one, which could help explain the data that suggests that they less commonly see it as a problem at Exeter. If you don&apos;t see it for yourself, it&apos;s hard to believe how prevalent it really may be.

          <strong>Melissa:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;63. Wow. This number is not just another data point. These are our classmates, our friends, our teammates, our dormmates, the girl or boy who sits across from you at the Harkness table. Think about it. This number holds 63 lives, all victims of some form of sexual misconduct. 
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Joonho:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw this statistic, I wish I was more surprised. It was heartbreaking to confirm my fear that there were more students who answered yes to this question than in any one dorm on campus.

          <strong>Melissa:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Something inside me just sank when I saw this. The harsh reality hit me. 47 of 52 students who did not report their case of sexual misconduct still would not come forward now. The saddest part: I understand why. I don&rsquo;t know if I would come forward either. It is so loud and clear we have much work to do. Stigma against victims along with many others barriers are still preventing students from feeling safe coming forward. We need to work to change the cultural environment that has isolated victims and create a response system that protects them. We need to do better, for these victims who still feel uncomfortable coming forward and for the victims who may feel uncomfortable in the future.
